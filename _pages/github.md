[Male-biased mutation rates in rattlesnakes](https://github.com/drewschield/male-biased_mutation_crotalus){: .btn .btn--info .text-center}

We compared levels of autosomal and Z-linked sequence divergence between rattlesnake (*Crotalus*) species to infer a ratio of male-to-female mutation rate. We found evidence of a ~2-fold male-biased mutation rate, which has ramifications for rates of evolution in sex-linked genes in snakes.

[Z-linked and autosomal genomic variation in barn swallows](https://github.com/drewschield/Z-chromosome_analysis_hirundo){: .btn .btn--info .text-center}

Using a whole-genome resequencing dataset, we explored genetic diversity and differentiation across the genome between barn swallow (*Hirundo rustica*) subspecies. We compared variation on the Z chromosomes and autosomes to infer how different evolutionary processes have impacted sex-linked genetic diversity in this young species complex. We inferred that low sex-linked diversity has been shaped by a combination of excess variance in male reproductive success, recent population bottlenecks, linked selection, and reduced gene flow on the Z chromosome.
