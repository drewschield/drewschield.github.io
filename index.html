    excerpt: "We just launched a new website for the [Schield Lab](https://schieldlab.org/) at the University of Virginia.<br><br>We study the evolutionary genomics and population genetics of speciation and adaptation to understand how evolutionary processes shape genetic variation and the origins of biodiversity. Our research is motivated and inspired by the natural history of our study organisms. We often study rattlesnakes as a model for investigating our research questions, along with interests in other systems like barn swallows, mammalian and squamate rattlesnake prey, and others. Check out the new website to find out more about our research and for examples of recent studies.<br><br>I'm currently recruiting a __PhD student__ to join the lab in Fall 2025, with opportunities to pursue diverse thesis topics with field, molecular, and computational components. Research topics include the genomic basis of pre- and postzygotic reproductive isolation, population genetics of coevolutionary antagonism between rattlesnakes and prey, sex chromosome evolution and regulation in snakes, and the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation in barn swallows and relatives.<br><br>I'm also eager to talk with prospective __postdocs__ seeking to lead projects related to these topics. Please reach out if you're interested in discussing research ideas and opportunities in the lab."
