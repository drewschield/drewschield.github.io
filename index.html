    title: "Starting the Schield Lab at UVA"
    excerpt: "I'm thrilled to be starting as a new assistant professor in the [Department of Biology](https://bio.as.virginia.edu/) at the University of Virginia in January, 2024.<br><br>The Schield Lab will study the evolutionary genomics and population genetics of speciation and adaptation to understand how genetic variation and evolutionary processes shape the origins of biodiversity. Our research is inspired by the natural history of our study organisms. We often study rattlesnakes as a model for investigating our research questions, along with interests in other systems like barn swallows, mammalian and squamate rattlesnake prey, and others. Follow the link below to check out recent studies.<br><br>I'm currently recruiting two PhD students to join the lab in Fall 2024, with opportunities to pursue diverse thesis topics with field, molecular, and computational components. Research topics include the genomic basis of pre- and postzygotic reproductive isolation, population genetics of coevolutionary antagonism between rattlesnakes and prey, sex chromosome evolution and regulation in snakes, and the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation in barn swallows and relatives.<br><br>I'm also interested in talking with prospective postdocs seeking to lead projects related to these topics. Please reach out if you're interested in discussing research ideas and opportunities in the lab."
